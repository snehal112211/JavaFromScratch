## Java
1.It is a open source programming language. But what is the difference bertween open source and close source programming language. let's see-  
# open Source-
It like a Vadapav when you go to the shop of vadapav that shop owner shows the whole process of making it. We can tell them to add any ingredient if we want.
Soure Code -Public
More developer support
Less security
eg Android
# close Source-
it like a MKD Burger we dont known that process instead we only order and take it. 
Source code - Private
no support
more security
eg iOS(iPhone Operating System)

2 Class Based(OOP)- model Oganized around the object rather than the function and data rather than logic. all except C follows it

3 java is platform independent.

# History- 
it is developed by sun Microsystem in 1991.
it was originally called as the Oak by James Goslin(Founder) 1995

# working-
Source code first compiled the byte code and then interpreted to the machine code.

# JDK - java development kit
collection of the tools use for developing and running the Java program
# JRE - Java runtime enviroment
Use for executing the program in the JAVA.Object Oriented: In object oriented programming everything is an object rather that function and logic.

# feature
Simple: Java is simple to understand, easy to learn and implement.

Secured: It is possible to design secured software systems using Java.

Platform Independent: Java is write once and run anywhere language, meaning once the code is written, it can be executed on any software and hardware systems.

Portable: Java is not necessarily fixated to a single hardware machine. Once created, java code can be used on any platform.

Architecture Neutral: Java is architecture neutral meaning the size of primitive type is fixed and does not vary depending upon the type of architecture.

Robust: Java emphasizes a lot on error handling, type checking, memory management, etc. This makes it a robust language.

Interpreted: Java converts high-level program statement into Assembly Level Language, thus making it interpreted.

Distributed: Java lets us create distributed applications that can run on multiple computers simultaneously.

Dynamic: Java is designed to adapt to ever evolving systems thus making it dynamic.

Multi-thread: multi-threading is an important feature provided by java for creating web applications.

High-performance: Java uses Just-In-Time compiler thus giving us a high performance.
